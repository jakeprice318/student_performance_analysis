# Student Performance Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project analyses factors affecting student exam performance using SQL and Tableau.

The objective was to identify relationships between:
- Study hours
- Attendance levels
- Tutoring sessions
- Score improvement

##  Tools Used
- MySQL (Data Analysis)
- Tableau Public (Dashboard & Visualisation)

---

##  Key Metrics Built
- Average Score Change
- % of Students Improved
- Average Exam Score
- Total Students

---

##  Analysis Performed (SQL)
Example queries included:

- Average score by attendance band
- Average score by tutoring sessions
- Score change distribution
- Study hours vs exam score

Full SQL script available:
`sql_queries/student_performance_analysis.sql`
